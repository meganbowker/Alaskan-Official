      <p>Yes. Not too often though, people go to certain places to see them, there are also better seasons for it than others.</p>

      <p>Realative to what? It<span>&#39;</span>s pretty cold, but the worst part of winter is how long it lasts. It also depends on your geographic location.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Normal things. People in Alaska generally like the outdoors though, including skiing, snowboarding, hiking, running, climbing, swimming, camping, boating, flying. People also drive, read, watch TV, go to the movies, drink, play gamesâ€¦</p>

      <img class="x" src= "Images/x.png">
      <img class="plus" src="./Images/arrowwide.png">
      </h3>
      <p>Bears generally only attack if they are suprised (or very hungry). Bear bells are a safety precaution.</p>

      <h3>Is it true you get paid to live in Alaska?

      </h3>
      <p>Not technically paid, but rewarded with what&rsquo;s called the Permanent Fund Dividend (or PFD) since 1976. The payouts are funded by Alaska&rsquo;s oil royalties and are divided up evenly among residents. The largest dividend was $3,269.00 per person in 2008 with an average of $1,185.28</p>

      <img class="x" src= "./Images/x.png">
      <img class="plus" src="./Images/arrowwide.png">
      </h3>
      <p>Huge. If you put it on top of a map of the lower 48 it would cover 1/3 of the rest of the states.</p>

      <p>Guns are common, and the laws aren<span>&#39;</span>t strict. You aren<span>&#39;</span>t required to have a license to carry a handgun either openly or concealed.</p>

      <p>It is dangerous, but it<span>&#39;</span>s probably not as dramatic as television makes it to be.

      <p>Alaska Standard Time. It<span>&#39;</span>s one hour less than Pacific Time.

      <h3>Have you ever built an igloo?

      <img class="plus" src="./Images/arrowwide.png">
      </h3>
      <p>I did once when I was young. It<span>&#39;</span>s like making a really sophistocated snowman.

      <h3>Do you own a snowmobile?
      <img class="x" src= "Images/x.png">
      <img class="plus" src="./Images/arrowwide.png">
      </h3>
      <p>I would say most people own snowmobiles, but Alaskans call them snowmachines. It<span>&#39;</span>s both a common hobbie and means of transportation.

      <img class="x" src= "Images/x.png">
      <img class="plus" src="./Images/arrowwide.png">
      </h3>
      <p>From New York, the shortest flight would be a little over 9 hours. Usually you would stop in Seattle though. Somewhere between 10-12 hours plus layvover.

    <img class="x" src= "Images/x.png">
    <img class="plus" src="./Images/arrowwide.png">
    </h3>
    <p>Actually, in Alaska you don<span>&#39;</span>t spend much time walking around outdoors unless you<span>&#39;</span>re prepared for it. Otherwise you<span>&#39;</span>re just walking from your car to a building. In New York for example, I spend a lot more time walking around in the winter and I definitely get cold.</p>

      <img class="x" src= "Images/x.png">

      <p>Yes. Actually, Anchorage has two of the most diverse neighborhoods in all of the US.
